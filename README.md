# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (RL) – History & Milestones  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm in **Machine Learning** where an agent learns by **interacting with an environment**, receiving **rewards or penalties**, and improving its policy to maximize long-term reward.

## ⏳ Timeline  

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **1950s** 🏛 | Early foundations → **Game theory** (von Neumann, Morgenstern) and **trial-and-error learning** concepts |
| **1959** 🔬 | **Arthur Samuel’s Checkers program** → one of the first self-learning agents |
| **1960s–70s** 🧩 | Research on **dynamic programming** (Richard Bellman) and **temporal-difference methods** |
| **1989** ⚡ | **Q-Learning** introduced (Watkins) → cornerstone of modern RL |
| **1990s** 📚 | **Policy Gradient methods** & **Actor-Critic algorithms** developed |
| **2013** 🎮 | **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** by DeepMind → agent learns to play Atari games directly from pixels |
| **2016** 🤖 | **AlphaGo** (DeepMind) defeats world champion in Go → breakthrough in RL + deep learning |
| **2017–2019** 🌍 | Advances in **multi-agent RL, robotics, and self-play** (AlphaZero, OpenAI Five) |
| **2020+** 🚀 | RL applied to **real-world tasks**: robotics, healthcare, finance, recommendation systems |
| **2023–2024** 🔥 | RLHF (**Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback**) drives **Generative AI (ChatGPT, LLMs)** |
